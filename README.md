## Files

- **Problem-1.java**  
  *Description:* A simple calculator implemented with a class that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
  *Notes:* Accepts two numbers (doubles) and an operator (string) as input, and outputs the result.  

- **Problem-2.java**  
  *Description:* Generates a series of odd numbers based on a single integer input.  
  *Example:* For an input of 3, the output is "1, 3, 5".  

- **Problem-3.java**  
  *Description:* Produces a modified series of odd numbers where the output series is based on whether the input is odd or even.  
  *Example:* For an input of 4, the output is "1, 3, 5".    

- **Problem-4.java**  
  *Description:* Counts how many numbers in an input array are multiples of each number between 1 and 9.  
  *Output:* A dictionary (using a HashMap) mapping each number (1â€“9) to its count.

## How to Run the Programs

1. **Ensure you have Java installed and configured** on your machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Compile the Java files:**

   For example, to compile the first problem, run:
   ```bash
   javac Problem1.java
   ```

4. **Run the compiled program:**

   For example, to run the first problem, execute:
   ```bash
   java Problem1
   ```

5. **Repeat the compilation and execution** steps for the remaining files (Problem2.java, Problem3.java, and Problem4.java).

## Compliance with Test Instructions

- A **public GitHub repository** was created to host the project.
- Each problem has been implemented in a **separate file** according to instructions.
- The coding language (Java) and sample inputs/outputs are clearly indicated in the code files.
- Solutions were developed independently and without the use of any external internet assistance during the test.
